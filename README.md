My nephew has some interest in learning JavaScript.  I figured I would build a quick angular.js app with 3 challenges in it.  If he can "hack" the app to show me the values, he can win monetary prizes.  Gives me some time to learn angular.js, and hopefully it'll inspire his curiousity.

# Install
Simply download the index.html and script.js.  Place them in the same directory and open index.html in a browser.
